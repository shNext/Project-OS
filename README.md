# Public Project-OS

This is managed in form of public project and opened to everyone who want this. <br/><br/>
Title : seems to be there nothing, but look at, the operating system. <br/>
Purpose : developing os for the system using multiple sensors under specific purpose for future mobility. <br/>
Outcome : sourcecode, if there is time to write a paper then includes it.

## Development Cycle

## Considerations

high-speed, connection, interfacing. <br/>
explain the reason why I choose above three things as first. <br/>   

high-speed for management. <br/>
connection for enhancement, function, flexibility. <br/>
interfacing for integration, extensibility. <br/>

how to design os related with project, compiler, what is the advantage. <br/>
everything doesnt have to do only on own os, for what. <br/>
grouping function-specific os. <br/>
do not associate with/think about platform. <br/>

how to maximize usability of the system without idle. <br/>

analyze, safety, security. <br/>

paradigm shift from traditional to next in os, define the way/direction. <br/>
do not associate with/think about ai. remind that this is system. <br/> 
automatic factory-like function-specific os without idle. specify the limitation and go inside more deeper.
