# Public Project-OS

This is managed in form of public project and opened to everyone who want this. <br/><br/>
Title : seems to be there nothing, but look at, the operating system. <br/>
Purpose : developing os for the system using multiple sensors under specific purpose for future mobility. <br/>
Outcome : sourcecode, if there is time to write a paper then includes it.

## Development Cycle

## Considerations

high-speed, connection, interfacing. <br/>
explain the reason why I choose above three things as first. <br/>   

high-speed for management. <br/>
connection for enhancement, function, flexibility. <br/>
interfacing for integration, extensibility. <br/>

how to design os related with project, compiler, what is the advantage. <br/>
everything doesnt have to do only on own os, for what. <br/>
grouping function-specific os. <br/>
do not associate with/think about platform. <br/>

how to maximize usability of the system without idle. <br/>

analyze, safety, security. <br/>

analysis for management. <br/>
safety for human. <br/>
security for system/somethings running on them. <br/>

paradigm shift from traditional to next in os, define the way/direction. <br/>
do not associate with/think about ai. remind that this is system. <br/> 
automatic factory-like function-specific os without idle. specify the limitation and go inside more deeper.

producing, scheduling, grouping. <br/>

define what is general-purpose/special-purpose os in this project. <br/>
half-automatic function-specific os grouped by domain-specific without idle. for what. <br/>

what is new features in this project comparing the traditional os. <br/>
how to combine/preserve/take advantage of the existing os ecosystem. <br/>
specify what is different with ai. <br/>

half-automatic function-specific fully-running-os grouped by domain-specific and the approach to utilize their ability considering the environments.

explain what I miss in this project such as ethics, law, etc for human focusing on safety and right. <br/>
what can I do for that in this project. <br/>

define machine-centric ethics in their world. <br/>
ehtics isnt just on individual but it needs social agreement in our world and machine also same, I think. <br/>
how to define unethical action. <br/>
all machine should know what is right and unright action by doing so if one of them has an unright action others can say "the machine is unethical". <br/>
but what is key concept in the agreement, how do we make a agreement to something, what is basic. <br/>

explain how to know right and unright action on machine without learning. <br/>
the principles for human-centric. <br/>
what is different between principle and rule in this project. <br/>
design the principles for machine/human co-ecosystem and how to create them. how to protect/keep the core in this project. <br/>

define what is the key elements of the basic considering that they are machine. <br/>
flexibility, restriction. <br/>
flexibility to continuously extend/expand the task of machine. could this be ego of machine. <br/>
if it is or not, explain about that. <br/>
restriction to protect the subjects on the ecosystem. could this be a agreement in the ecosystem. <br/>
if it is or not, explain about that. <br/>

without data, explainable algorithms-based at least how it works in internals, for safety. <br/>

I think I have too much thinking. ðŸ˜„ <br/>
the algorithm could be similar with reinforcement learning but my concept of the algorithm/approach is getting out from the complicate and multi-stage learning based on the massive data and its dependency. <br/>
I'm not sure that I can do but this challenge will bring us new way for the people who live in the world. <br/>
I sincerely hope this project will be one of the way to start/make positive effect to the people, industry, economy, and many diverse area. <br/>

end for consideration.
